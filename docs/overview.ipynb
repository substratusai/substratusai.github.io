    "The Model resource is at the center of Substratus. A Model object represents an instance of a ML model (source code bundled together with weights and biases). A Model object can describe various sources for a model: Git (Substratus will clone the repo and build a container containing the model), or another Model coupled with a training Dataset (Substratus will run a training Job on the base Model with the provided data, and build a new container image containing the trained model). All other Substratus resources exist to facilitate the progression of Model objects.\n",

    "\n",
    "The Notebook resource facilitates the development of ML source code. Unlike regular applications which can typically be developed on modest laptops, developing a ML model typically requires high performance compute (i.e. GPUs with lots of memory). A Notebook object represents an instance of a Jupyter Notebook environment that is running on beefy hardware within a Kubernetes cluster. Substratus tooling, such as the `kubectl open notebook` plugin, allows developers to open these notebooks on their local machines.\n",

    "Because Substratus relies on Kubernetes port-forwarding, administrators do not need to manage TLS certificates, networking ingress paths, and bespoke firewall rules. Substratus users just need access to the Kubernetes API server (they need to be able to download Kubernetes credentials). Most companies already have a method in place of distributing these kubeconfig files.\n",
