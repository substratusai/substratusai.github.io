# Introduction

Substratus is a cross cloud substrate for training and serving ML models. Substratus extends the Kubernetes control plane to orchestrate ML operations through the addition of new API endpoints: Model, ModelServer, Dataset, and Notebook.

## Why Substratus?

* Train and serve models from within your cloud account. Your data stays private.
* Leverage containers to avoid library lock-in and dependency wrangling.
* Let substratus calculate your resource requirements and automatically provision GPUs, CPUs, and Memory.
* Adopt best practice conventions by default.
* Train pre-packaged state of the art models on your own datasets.
* Leverage GitOps out of the box.
