# Introduction

Substratus is a cross-cloud substrate for training and serving ML models. Substratus extends the Kubernetes control plane to orchestrate ML operations through the addition of new API endpoints: Model, Server, Dataset, and Notebook.

## Why Substratus?

* Finetune and deploy OSS LLMs with no code required and built-in optimizations.
* Launch remote Jupyter notebooks with a single command.
* Run anywhere Kubernetes runs.
* Install with minimal dependencies (a bucket and container registry).
* Keep your data inside your network.
* Scale to zero (save on GPU costs).
* Leverage containers for reproducible environments.
* Leverage GitOps out of the box.

Note: Substratus might still introduce backward incompatible changes to the APIs until v1.0 is released.
