Fine-tune and serve LLMs on your Kubernetes clusters in your cloud.\\n\\nCan\u2019t wait? - Get started with our [quick start\\ndocs](https://www.substratus.ai/docs/quickstart) or hop over to our [GitHub\\nrepo](https://github.com/substratusai/substratus).\\n\\n## **Why Substratus?**\\n\\n**Press the fast-button for ML**: Leverage out of the box container images to\\nload a base model, optionally fine-tune with your own dataset and spin up a\\nmodel server, all without writing any code.\\n\\n**Notebook-integrated workflows:** Launch a remote, containerized, GPU-enabled\\nnotebook from a local directory with a single command. Develop in the exact same\\nenvironment as your long running training jobs.\\n\\n**No vendor lock-in**: Substratus is open-source and can run anywhere Kubernetes\\nruns.\\n\\n**Keep company data internal**: Deploy in your cloud account. Training data and\\ninference APIs stay within your company\u2019s network.\\n\\n**Best practices by default:** Substratus models are immutable and contain\\ninformation about their lineage. Datasets are imported and snapshotted using\\noff-the-shelf manifests. Training executes in containerized environments, using\\nimmutable base artifacts. Inference servers are pre-configured to leverage\\nquantization on supported models. GitOps is built-in, not bolted-on.\\n\\n## **Guiding Principles**\\n\\nAs we continue to develop Substratus, we\u2019re grounded in the following guiding\\nprinciples:\\n\\n### **1. Prioritize Simplicity**\\n\\n We believe the importance of minimizing complexity in software cannot be\\n understated. In Substratus, we will work hard to keep complexity to a minimum\\n as the project grows. The Substratus API currently consists of 4 resource\\n types: Datasets, Models, Servers, and Notebooks. The project currently depends\\n on two cloud services outside of the cluster: a bucket and a container registry\\n (we are working on making these optional too). The project does not (and will\\n never) depend on a web of complex components like Istio.\\n\\n### **2. Prioritize UX**\\n\\nWe believe a company\u2019s most precious resource is their engineer\u2019s time.\\nSubstratus seeks to maximize the productivity of data scientists and engineers\\nthrough providing a best-in-class user experience. We strive to build a set of\\nwell-designed primitives that allow ML practitioners to enter a flow state as\\nthey move between importing data, training, and serving models.\\n\\n## **Roadmap**\\n\\nWe are fast at work adding new functionality, focused on creating the most\\nproductive and enjoyable platform for ML practitioners. Coming soon:\\n\\n1. Support for AWS and Azure\\n2. VS Code Notebook Integration\\n3. Large-scale distributed training\\n4. ML ecosystem integrations\\n\\nTry Substratus today in your GCP project by following the [quick start\\ndocs](https://www.substratus.ai/docs/quickstart). Let us know what features you\\nwould like to see on our [GitHub\\nrepo](https://github.com/substratusai/substratus) and don\u2019t forget to add a\\nstar!"}]}')}}]);
