Fine-tune and serve LLMs on your Kubernetes clusters in your cloud.\\n\\nCan\u2019t wait? - Get started with our [quick start docs](https://www.substratus.ai/docs/quickstart) or hop over to our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/substratusai/substratus).\\n\\n## **_Why Substratus?_**\\n\\n**Press the fast-button for ML**: Leverage out of the box container images to load a base model, optionally fine-tune with your own dataset and spin up a model server, all without having to write any code.\\n\\n**Notebook-integrated workflows:** Launch a remote, containerized, gpu-enabled notebook from a local directory with a single command. Develop in the exact same environment as your long running jobs will run in.\\n\\n**No vendor lock-in**: Substratus is open-source and can run anywhere Kubernetes runs.\xa0\\n\\n**Keep company data internal**: Deploy in your cloud account. Training data and inference APIs stay within your company\u2019s network.\\n\\n**Best practices by default:** Substratus models are immutable and contain information about their lineage. Datasets are imported and snapshotted using off-the-shelf manifests. Training executes in containerized environments, using immutable base artifacts. Inference servers are preconfigured to leverage quantization on supported models. GitOps is built in, not bolted on.\\n\\n## **_Guiding Principles_**\\nAs we continue to develop Substratus, we\u2019re grounded in the following guiding principles:\\n\\n### **1. Prioritize Simplicity**\\n We believe the importance of minimizing complexity in software cannot be understated. In Substratus, we will work hard to keep complexity to a minimum as the project grows. The Substratus API currently consists of 4 resource types: Datasets, Models, Servers, and Notebooks. The project currently depends on two cloud services outside of the cluster: a bucket and a container registry (we are working on making these optional too). The project does not (and will never) depend on a web of complex components like Istio.\\n\\n### **2. Prioritize UX**\\nWe believe a company\u2019s most precious resource is their engineer\u2019s time. Substratus seeks to maximize the productivity of data scientists and engineers through providing a best-in-class user experience. We strive to build a set of well-designed primitives that allow ML practitioners to enter a flow state as they move between importing data, training, and serving models.\\n## **_Roadmap_**\\n\\nWe are fast at work adding new functionality, focused on creating the most productive and enjoyable platform for ML practitioners. Coming soon:\xa0\\n\\n1. Support for AWS and Azure\\n2. VS Code Notebook Integration\\n3. Large-scale distributed training\\n4. ML ecosystem integrations\\n\\nTry Substratus today in your GCP project by following the [quick start docs](https://www.substratus.ai/docs/quickstart).
